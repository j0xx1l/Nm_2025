# Automated Essay Feedback System

The increasing demand for scalable and personalized education tools has led to the development of automated systems that assist students in improving their writing skills. This project focuses on the creation of an **Automated Essay Feedback System** leveraging **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques, specifically designed to evaluate student essays.

## Objective
The primary objective of this system is to provide detailed feedback on essays, focusing on various critical aspects such as:

- **Content Quality**
- **Vocabulary Errors** (spelling, grammar, etc.)
- **Reasoning Gaps**
- **Logical Flaws**

The system uses a **BERT-based model** to generate embeddings for essay text and a **Sentence Transformer model (SBERT)** to provide semantic similarity scores for better content understanding. 

## Dataset
The system evaluates these aspects using a well-established dataset, the **PERSUADE corpus**, consisting of **25,000 student-written argumentative essays**.

## Key Features
The model is fine-tuned for:

- **Argumentative Structure Analysis**
- Providing **adaptive feedback** using a **language model (LLM)**.

## Personalization Module
This project also integrates a **personalization module** to adjust feedback based on individual student performance, enhancing the effectiveness of the feedback for each user.

## End Result
The end result is a fully functioning **NLP-driven platform** that offers actionable feedback, which can help learners:

- Identify gaps in reasoning
- Correct vocabulary issues
- Improve their overall essay-writing skills

This feedback system aims to act as a **virtual tutor** capable of supporting students in achieving better writing outcomes in automated, scalable environments.
